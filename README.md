# This plugin is not actively maintained, I no longer own a BlueAir and cannot fix issues - Repo is up for adoption.

## An alternative plugin

Fraser has done a great job on a new dynamic, platform based plugin that was based on this foundation - please give his a try as an alternative! [fjs21/homebridge-blueair](https://github.com/fjs21/homebridge-blueair)

## homebridge-blueair
This is a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin which lets you integrate your non-HomeKit [BlueAir](https://www.blueair.com/gb/air-purifiers) air purifier into HomeKit.

Currently supported are all Classic i-Series air purifiers, however, Classic series without sensors but do have wifi controls, should be supportable if I can be provided with API output by anyone!

This plugin exposes all BlueAir (Foobot) API characteristics and assigns them to native HomeKit Characteristics. The plugin will also mimic the Elgato Eve *Room* device such that, if using Eve.app on an iOS device, you will have historical logging and graphs of these metrics.

Currently all history state is stored on the local filesystem of the device running homebridge.

## Releases
See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/mylesgray/homebridge-blueair/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## To-dos
See [open enhancement issues](https://github.com/mylesgray/homebridge-blueair/labels/enhancement)

## API research
There is no documented API for the BlueAir devices, through some API proxying with Charles I was able to find out they use the Foobot API backend for their intelligence and map all requests for get/set.

### Postman collection and environment
I coallated all requests that my device made into an easy-to-use [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/1a8ff6c577e58a7b6f90).

You need to create a Postman Environment with the following variables in it to use the collection:

## Thanks

This plugin is heavily based on (hacked together from) two other plugins, [homebridge-efergy](https://github.com/luc-ass/homebridge-efergy) and [homebridge-mi-air-purifier](https://github.com/seikan/homebridge-mi-air-purifier), without these plugins I could not have created the foundation on which this was built. Thanks to @luc-ass and @seikan for their work on these.

The [fakegato-history](https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history) plugin on which this is based was built by @simont77, without this, we wouldn't have pretty graphs to gawk at.
